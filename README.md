In this project a machine learning approach was used to predict the essential genes in bacteria which can be further used in efficient drug designing process. Earlier known methods for gene essentiality prediction were mostly experimental and hence were time consuming, laborious and expensive. Since there are some computational methods but with low predictive scores. Our work produced high predictive scores for gene essentiality in an organism so that the results can have significant impact in drug designing.

The project has also been selected for Publication in Springer at ICCI 2017 (IIT Kanpur). Link to the Website : https://www.iitk.ac.in/idea/ICCI2017/
